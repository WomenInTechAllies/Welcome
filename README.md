Welcome to Women In Tech Allies

We do a lot of communication through the Facebook group so please, join it.

Women in Tech Allies is a group to advocate for women in tech careers through networking, tech talks, mentorship, etc. We look for opportunities to support our current peers in tech, women attempting to transition into tech from other backgrounds, as well as helping our youth grow into future tech leaders.

Change comes from within. For the tech and dev community to become more inclusive and accessible for women and other underrepresented demographics, those already within the community must be part of that change.

Women in Tech Allies is a space to apply your interests, expertise, experience, knowledge, support and encouragement to promote new tech talent. We encourage all genders, races and backgrounds to join our meetup and the tech community.
